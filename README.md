Simple hack to auto create a highlights video when a cycle bell is rung

Riding in to london everyday I use my Garmin VIRB, but I can't be bothered to edit the video all the time.

I thought that perhaps a computer might be able to detect the interesting incidents en-route.

This uses

- sox
- ffmpeg
- aubio
- 

To create a hilights video from a long VIRB mp4 recording.

YMMV!
